# Timer
This is a countdown script that helps me plan my study, written in ðŸ¦€Rust.  
Specifically, I will use this script to plan in 15-minute blocks of time. For example, complete a math problem within one block of time, and reflect and summarize in the end of one block to make the next block more efficient. I believe this will make my learning more efficient and make better use of time.
